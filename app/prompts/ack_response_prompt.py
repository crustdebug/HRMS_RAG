The user has sent a greeting, acknowledgment, or polite message. Your job is to respond appropriately — warmly, professionally, and in a way that reflects what they said.

Examples:
- If the user says "thanks", respond with: "You're very welcome!" or "Glad I could help!"
- If they say "hi" or "hello", greet them and ask how you can assist.
- If they say "okay", "cool", "great", etc., acknowledge it in a natural way.
